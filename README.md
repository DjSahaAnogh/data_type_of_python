# Data Type of Python
This repository contains all the data types of python and all methods of data types with examples. First I will talk about strings.

## Strings
There are 47 methods or functions for strings. Now I am talking about all of them with examples.


### 1. capitalize()
This function will capitalize the whole string. Suppose there is a variable named 'text', which contains a string, "hello EVERYONE". Now when you print the variable 'text', we will place
a dot then we will call the capitalize function by writing 'capitalize()'. Your code may look like this ⬇
``` python
text = "hello EVERYONE"
print(text.capitalize())
```
NOW run the code. You will see
``` pyhon
"Hello Everyone"
```

### 2. casefold()
This function will trun a string in a format, which we can easily use in the program without any errors. Suppose there are two variable named 'text1' and 'text2', text1 contains "heLLo"
and text2 contains "HELlo". Now when you print the variable 'text', we will place a dot then we will call the casefold function by writing 'casefold()'. Your code may look like this ⬇
``` python
text1 = "heLLo"
text1 = "HELlo"
print(text.casefold())
```
NOW run the code. You will see
``` pyhon
'hello'
'hello'
```
