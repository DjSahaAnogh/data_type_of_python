# Data Type of Python
This repository contains all the data types of python and all methods of data types with examples. First I will talk about strings.

## Strings
There are 47 methods or functions for strings. Now I am talking about all of them with examples.


### 1. capitalize()
This function will capitalize the whole string. Suppose there is a variable named 'text', which contains a string, "hello EVERYONE". Now when you print the variable 'text', we will place
a dot then we will call the capitalize function by writing 'capitalize()'. Your cade may look like this â¬‡
``` python
text = "hello EVERYONE"
print(text.capitalize())
```
NOW run the code. You will see
``` pyhon
"Hello Everyone"
```
